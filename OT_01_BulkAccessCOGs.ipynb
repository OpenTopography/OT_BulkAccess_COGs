    "## Purpose\n",
    "[OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/) strives to provide a variety of access methods to our datasets to address the varying needs of our users. While most users access data through the web map interface, others prefer to programmatically access data from our cloud-based storage. In this tutorial we will explore a couple of different methods of accessing data over the Grand Canyon from the cloud-based [NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) catalog in OpenTopography](https://doi.org/10.5069/G9445JDF).  We will also demonstrate how we can use open-source, command line tools to programmatically access data without the need for a web-map interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this tutorial should highlight the power of [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs),](https://www.cogeo.org/) and how they can be used to reduce download file sizes as well as increase data access speeds.  COGs are quickly becoming a standard format for hosting raster data in the cloud due to its optimized file structure to enable faster access and subsetting. In order to take advantage of this benefit, [OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/) has recently converted its entire global dataset collection to COGs. With the COG format, programs and web requests can read the top-level header and quickly extract data for a region of interest as opposed to having to read the entire file.  This drastically reduces file read-time as well as reducing the number of http GET requests to access the data.  For a more detailed discussion on COGs and their benefits see the resources section at the bottom of this page.\n",

    "Using Rasterio with OpenTopography's VRT of COGs, we are able to download only the portion of the SRTM data we need. In this example, we downloaded only data that is within our 10 km polygon buffer of the portion of Colorado River around the Grand Canyon. **Our final output raster is only 12MB, versus the 86MB of tiffs we started with at the beginning!!** By putting all these tools together, users can create powerful scripts that automate data access, and ultimately reduce time on data downloads and post-processing.  \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Hopefully this tutorial has been helpful, and has demonstrated alternative methods to accessing cloud-based data. There are often many different ways to accomplish the same task, and we highlighted some of the more common tools and methods to perform some basic geospatial operations. We encourage users to explore datasets hosted at OpenTopography with these powerful tools. OpenTopography has various global datasets that are available through our API and/or bulk access as described in this article:\n",
