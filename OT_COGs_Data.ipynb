    "[OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/) strives to provide a variety of access methods to our datasets to address the varying needs of our users. While most users access data through the web map interface, others prefer to programmatically access data from our cloud-based storage. In this tutorial we will explore a couple of different methods of accessing data over the Grand Canyon from the cloud-based [NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) catalog in OpenTopography](https://doi.org/10.5069/G9445JDF).  We will also demonstrate how we can use open-source, command line tools to programmatically access data without the need for a web-map interface. In addition, this tutorial should highlight the power of [Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (COGs).](https://www.cogeo.org/) and how they can be used to reduce download filesizes as well as increase data access speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "COGs are quickly becoming a standard format for hosting raster data in the cloud due to its optimized file structure to enable faster access and subsetting. In order to take advantage of this benefit, [OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/) has recently converted its entire global dataset collection to COGs. With the COG format, programs and web requests can read the top-level header and quickly extract data for a region of interest as opposed to having to read the entire file.  This drastically reduces file read-time as well as reducing the number of http GET requests to access the data.  For a more detailed discussion on COGs and their benefits see the resources section at the bottom of this page.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, it is recommended to set up a conda environment with GDAL 3.2 and AWS CLI tools installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# Create a conda environment called, 'COGS', and install GDAL v 3.2:\n",

    "By using the VRTs we have now have a single, mosaiced geotiff that is much smaller in size than the original tiled images.  But we can take this further by using the power of COGs and other python libraries.  So, let's say we really only want data around the Colorado River.  To do this, we first need to get a vector representation of the Colorado River.  Luckily, there is a fantastic site called, [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) that has a wealth of vector and raster map data at a variety of scales.  For this example, we'll use the rivers and lakes centerlines file.  You can download the data from the [Natural Earth Data Download site](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/) or you can use wget.  You may need to install wget with a pip command:"

    "Now we have river data, but it is for the entire world. Next we'll clip the river dataset to our area of interest using [GDAL's vector toolkit](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html#ogr2ogr).  We also want to create a buffer around the river, but in order to do that we need to project the data.  As downloaded, the river data is in a Geographic Coordinate System, so we will need to output the data in a projected coordinate system in order to do the buffering operation.  Arizona is in UTM zone 12N, so we'll use [EPSG:32612](https://epsg.io/32612) for the output projection.  Using the ogr2ogr tool we can output a projected, clipped version of the river shapefile with the following command:"

In this example, we downloaded only data that is within our 10 km polygon buffer of the portion of Colorado River around the Grand Canyon.  **Our final output raster is only 12MB, versus the 86MB of tiffs we started with at the beginning!!**  By putting all these tools together, users can create powerful scripts that automate data access, and ultimately reduce time on data downloads and post-processing.  \n",
